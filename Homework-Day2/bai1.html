          This week I am <em>extremely</em> excited about cooking technique called
          <i>sous vide</i>. In <i>sous vide</i> cooking, you submerge the food
          (usually vacuum sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely
          set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to. In
          his book, <cite>Cooking for Geeks</cite>, Jeff Potter describes it as
          “ultra-low temperature poaching”.

          Next month, we will be serving
          <strong>Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise</strong>. To reserve a seat at
          the chef's table, contact us before November 30.

            Warning: Sous vide cooked salmon is not pasteurized. Avoid it if
            you are pregnant or have immunity issues.
